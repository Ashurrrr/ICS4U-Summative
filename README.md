Title of the project: GM Wars (subject to potential change)

GM Wars would be an app that gives advanced suggestions for fantasy sports and betting. "GM" being a double entendre as the acronym is most commonly know as "GrandMaster" but in sports would be known as "General Manager" or the indivudal that controls a team. Version 1 of the project will be focused on basketball specifically the NBA. The app will use statistics and formulas to inform the user in making decisions for fantasy sports and bets. Python would be essential in updating numbers in real time for its continuous machine learning. It can easily be integrated with other technologies to form a visually appealing front end interface.

Our goal is to create a fantasy basketball genius using algorithms and user inputs to inform the user on decisions for their fantasy team. We would like to complete this idea and see if it could start by helping us in our fantasy basketball league and then add different scenarios and see how the program performs.

To create a fantasy sports app, we will need a range of coding technologies, including: front-end web development as well as back-end, API's to collect data from different sources (websites, social media, etc). The other specifics of potential technolgy we need will be updated once our idea is fully planned out, analyzed and started.
